# Flutter App that Generate English Word Pairs

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

- If encounter this when run:
Exception: Unable to generate build files

Upon upgrading from Visual Studio 2019 to 2022, we need to delete CMakeCache.txt in application builds, or we'll encounter a build failure.

Quick fix:
- flutter clean
- flutter run
to rebuild the app without fails
